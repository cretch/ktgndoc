It's available through various means - On the web, by clicking on this link - Via an app ( Android , Apple or TV Android ) According to your TV specs, you may be able to \"cast\" the videos to your TV from your phone. This documentation is taking the web version as example. On other means, it should be quite the same. Connexion \u00b6 Can't be simpler : just enter your username and password. Quick connect is there for special hardware like you TV, or gaming console, on which you don't have a proper keyboard. Home \u00b6 Sidebar (Shortcuts to libraries and user settings) \"Cast\" to another compatible screen. Handy if you want to browse the mediacenter on your phone but see on the TV. Search for a title User settings Main part User settings \u00b6 here you can customize your user experience... Normally, you shouldn't have anything to change here... Profile (to change password) Quick Connect (to be used when you want to connect to a TV or a gaming console) Display (To change certain graphical options, time, language of the interface, etc...) Home (to change your homescreen, hide certain sections, etc...) Playback (To change video quality, favored language when available, etc... ) Subtitles (Subtitle preferences) Control (to activate joystick navigation) Main navigation \u00b6 Please note that when you hover your mouse over a thumbnail, a Play button will appear. This starts playback straight away. If you want to see a media file, click on the title below. The first line contains the libraries. You can scroll through them using the little arrow at the top right. Click on the thumbnail to see the details of the libraries. I have added categories with only english/german/spanish content. The \"movies\" and \"tvshows\" categories wil contain mainly french stuff. The other lines allow you to see the most recently started media, and then the recent additions below. Books \u00b6 In Jellyfin, books are classified by author. It's pretty basic, you need to enter an author to see a list of his or her titles. If you click Play, the title will load into memory, which can take considerably longer for graphic formats. Navigating between pages is simply a matter of using the keyboard. The check mark indicates that you have already read the book, and the heart allows you to add it to a list of favourites. If you click on the title, you'll be taken to the book description. This is only useful if you want to download a local copy (via the second icon \u2b07\ufe0f). Movies \u00b6 The interface is a little more cluttered here... In the top navigation, there are three important tabs: Films, the one you're basically in Suggestions, which suggests films based on what you've already seen. Genres, which classifies films according to genre. Well, it's a very... creative classification, you might say. On the right of the screen, you can display only films with a certain letter. When you click on a movie name, you'll land on movies details To change between audio tracks, if available To change subtitles. I'll explain a bit below how to get new ones if there is one missing. Play the movie Play a trailer Chekc to set the movie as already played Check to add the movie to your liked ones. Various options (see below) Download movie offline and subtitles \u00b6 Here are two very useful options. You can download a movie to your device. Ideal when you plan a trip and want to download some movies beforehand. You can also seach for subtitles! It's pretty simple. Just select a language, click search button and select one of the results. Favoring the most downloaded one usually yields the best results. Filters and sorting \u00b6 Arrows, to navigate between pages View, to change the presentation of the list Sorting Filtering Music \u00b6 Here is my music, organized in different tabs. Easiest way to navigate here is by artist, or genre, maybe. TV shows \u00b6 It's the same is in movies, except you'll have the seasons list on the first screen, then you can see the detailed episodes list. Content playback \u00b6 Change subtitles Change audio track Change playback speed, quality, format Changing the format won't take away black bands integrated inside the file sadly.","title":"Jellyfin"},{"location":"katagena/jellyfin/#jellyfin","text":"Jellyfin is a mediacenter that you can access after you're received credentials from me (shared with Jellyseerr ).
